1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,540
Hardware, innovation, money and power
collide in Silicon Valley and beyond.

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,860
This is Bloomberg Technology with
Caroline Hyde and Ed Ludlow.

3
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,560
I from New York and San francisco.
This is Bloomberg Technology.

4
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,490
Coming up, netflix out a record.
The king of streaming surpasses Wall

5
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,330
Street's expectations on every major
financial metric.

6
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,610
Plus, after iPhone sales stall in a
major market overseas, a sign of

7
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,790
success.
And why Tesla is in the crosshairs of a

8
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,500
federal agencies investigation.
And yeah, let's get right to Netflix.

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,250
And this.
This is the stock, right?

10
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,990
You can see on the screen the story on
track for its biggest jump since January

11
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,200
of this year, trading at a record high
overall.

12
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,720
And subscribers beat revenue beat.
And we always talk about earnings in the

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,070
context of beating expectations
numerically on metrics.

14
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,850
But I think we both agree right Karowe
that the story was different to what we

15
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,190
were expecting a slowdown in streaming?
No, actually, things seem to be okay for

16
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,200
Netflix.
I think there's a lot to get into about

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,310
what's happening with the consumer's
attitude towards streaming platforms and

18
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,570
how we're watching content right now.
Yeah, the co-CEO and sounding upbeat.

19
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,280
Ted Sarandos really talking about how
the company beat those expectations, but

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,770
also what you can expect in 2025.
Take a listen.

21
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,120
Let's start with, you know, looking into
2025, we're feeling really good about

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,150
the business.
We had a plan to re accelerate growth

23
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,320
and we delivered on that plan.
You can see that in our 2024 financials,

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,880
we expect to deliver 15% revenue growth
and six percentage points of operating

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,130
margin improvement and engagement, which
we view as our best proxy for member

26
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,590
happiness.
Because when people watch more, they

27
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,540
stick around longer.
So that's retention.

28
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,240
Felix Gillette joins us.
And Felix, it really was a case of even

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,949
without the stellar slate they have
coming up in fourth quarter.

30
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,210
They managed to really build on that.
5 million subscribers for the third.

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,590
Yeah, I think it was better than
everyone expected.

32
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,250
I think it's particularly impressive
because you have to remember this is the

33
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,010
year following the dual strikes in
Hollywood.

34
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,780
So there's this huge production
slowdown.

35
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,960
At the time everyone was speculating
like, well, there's not enough new

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,570
things to watch.
Why would people keep subscribing to

37
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,670
these streaming services, including
Netflix?

38
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,920
There's going to be a lot of churn, a
lot of cancellations.

39
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,500
And yet, in spite of that, a year later,
you know, Netflix adds another 5 million

40
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,450
subscribers.
This quarter is up to 282 plus million

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,820
across the globe.
So, yeah, it's a very strong order for

42
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,640
Netflix.
And like Sarandos said, they have an

43
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,300
even better slate, I think you could
argue, coming up next quarter and next

44
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,050
year.
So he talks about this interesting

45
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,500
metric, which is I think he called it
engagement, right?

46
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,710
Felix And misdirect.
So let's bring Felix's shot back up

47
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,320
because I don't think he's had much time
to watch Netflix.

48
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,270
He's been too busy reading the piles of
books either side of his shoulder.

49
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,650
But there was a time when Netflix said,
Stop judging us on subscriber growth.

50
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,550
Just look at our financial metrics.
Now they say, don't judge us on

51
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,860
financial metrics.
We really want to talk about this

52
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,700
engagement number.
What does it mean and where is it going?

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,260
I think when you look at the engagement
number, part of that is where is their

54
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,850
future growth going to come from?
And a lot of that is advertising, right?

55
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,930
They said yesterday, you know, we're not
where we're at, where we want to be at

56
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,180
in terms of advertising revenue, but
we're investing in technology and we're

57
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,420
investing in better inventory.
And what that means is investing in

58
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,510
better live programming.
And they just have a ton of stuff coming

59
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,950
down the pipeline.
Wrestling, 3 hours of live wrestling a

60
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,380
week.
They're going to have NFL games.

61
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,450
They're doing more comedy live specials.
Last week at our conference in L.A.,

62
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,850
they announced they're going to do this
live variety show.

63
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,290
And I think that's going to be very
appealing to advertisers once they get a

64
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,339
certain crucial number of viewers there.
And I think that's where the engagement

65
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,290
comes from.
And I think that's what they're really

66
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,520
excited about now.
But I think you can't separate that from

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,500
their ambitions in advertising.
Well, maybe he's kind of excited about

68
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,740
the next edition of Wednesday because I
can spot thing lurking behind your right

69
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,320
shoulder at the moment.
Yes.

70
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,460
Amazing.
Felix to that we thank you so much at.

71
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,520
Let's get some more data from Brandon
Katz.

72
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,060
He's the senior entertainment industry
strategist at Parrot Analytics.

73
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,510
And there's actually a data point that
you point to which I find fascinating,

74
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,200
and that is Netflix's share in corporate
demand.

75
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,160
Explain that metric and why you think it
makes Netflix a leader.

76
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,650
So corporate demand share really looks
at all the original programming that a

77
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,640
company creates, and it helps value
their viability in the current media

78
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,960
market and potentially the value of that
content on the opening market should

79
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,170
they ever want to license it for the
first time ever.

80
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:24,050
Netflix has leapfrogged a legacy media
company by beating NBCUniversal, and we

81
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,120
have to remember NBC Universal's
programming dates back to the 1940s with

82
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,350
NBC, whereas Netflix has only been an
original programmer for about 12 years.

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,330
So the fact that their library has grown
this significantly this quickly is a

84
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,350
major testament to the amassed content
that they have built.

85
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,980
They have had to spend a lot on that
content.

86
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,540
And the point is now whether they have
to spend a lot on live content on sports

87
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,810
to really drum up this advertising
prowess that actually Amazon seems to

88
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,140
have nailed in many ways.
Yeah.

89
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,770
And with Amazon expanding its ad tier
next year to five additional markets,

90
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,030
the pressure is on Netflix to grow this
advertising tier.

91
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,850
It's been a slow but steady first two
years.

92
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,930
But what's really concerning is that
Netflix is you can average revenue per

93
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,340
user has dropped for two straight
quarters because of that ad tier growth.

94
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,090
So it's a little bit of a give and take.
I would not be surprised if with the

95
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:24,370
addition of WWE and NFL games, we see a
increase in the price for the ad

96
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:29,500
supported tier in 2025 some time.
What about price point of the service

97
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,200
more broadly, many anticipating that we
could get some price hikes.

98
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,550
In fact, they just enacted some today.
Absolutely.

99
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,100
We're getting international price hikes.
I would not be surprised if another

100
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,300
youcan't price hike is around the
corner, particularly off the back of

101
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,960
their extremely strong anticipated Q4
content slate.

102
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,160
And as they mentioned, the production
logjam is starting to normalize

103
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,860
following the strike.
So we could probably expect a little bit

104
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,410
more volume in terms of new originals in
2025, which also bolsters their case in

105
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,010
raising prices yet again.
So consumers maybe watch that wallet a

106
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,250
little bit more.
Okay.

107
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,260
If you're just joining us here on
Bloomberg Technology, Netflix shares are

108
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,400
up more than 10%, the biggest jump since
January, but they're trading at their

109
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,960
highest level ever on record.
And I think a big part of that is, is

110
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,900
there is still subscriber growth and
brand.

111
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,600
And that was the story we were kind of
considering with this slowdown.

112
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,670
You mentioned a moment ago the live
events.

113
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,510
I want to go deeper into that.
How much of a feature this will be of

114
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,710
the platform going forward?
Yeah.

115
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,810
Live events has not worked seamlessly
for any streaming platform consistently.

116
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,920
It's always been simulcast on these
legacy media distribution networks and

117
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,890
their streaming services.
So Netflix is really trying to break new

118
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,240
ground by making live entertainment on a
streaming only service work.

119
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,690
And it is certainly a huge point of
focus for them moving forward to

120
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,460
supercharge their ad tier.
And I think then focusing the first ten

121
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,090
years of their kind of original content
development around building out the back

122
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,690
end by licensing other content and
building up a massive library is the

123
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,630
right way to go about it.
I think they're well positioned to dive

124
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,010
deeper into sports because of it now.
Nice.

125
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,120
We got some bridgerton up on the screen.
That's a household favor for us.

126
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,510
What do you make of management?
We're kind of in deeper into this period

127
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,750
where you have the co-CEO structure.
You think they're doing a good job?

128
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,050
I think they're doing a fantastic job.
And I think Greg Peters is one of the

129
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,130
only Hollywood media executives with
actual coding and software experience.

130
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,630
And I think as we dive into an even more
digital future, trying to capture Gen Z

131
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:41,230
retention and Gen Alpha's attention, who
are digital natives, it's going to be

132
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:46,330
very, very, very important to understand
how the tech works and what the consumer

133
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,020
experience on that tech is actually
like, and Netflix is taking a step

134
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,810
forward with that.
Yeah, I mean, they've really beefed out

135
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,410
the ability to carry live events.
I mean, we all think back to the Love is

136
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,840
Blind disaster.
When they tried to carry that live and

137
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,310
we saw the demand just to get down.
But from that, just reflect a little bit

138
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,660
on ultimately where else Gen Z
millennials are going because yes, you

139
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,410
cite the old school that they've
overtaken in terms of just sheer volume

140
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,070
of content, but people are spending that
time on Tik Tok on YouTube.

141
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,340
How are they matching up in terms of
addiction there?

142
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,400
The concern with Netflix is that it's a
pure play, traditional entertainment

143
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,890
service that is focused on film and TV
and yet video games, short form media

144
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,820
via the creator economy and other new
media are driving growth in the

145
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,230
entertainment ecosystem as film and TV
endure a painful contract contraction.

146
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,460
Yes, Netflix is building out a suite of
video games, but we've had no material

147
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,930
updates on its impact as they try to
build an added value in-house bundle

148
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,630
that goes beyond just traditional film
and TV.

149
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,100
So that's why I think perhaps Netflix is
slightly overvalued at the moment, even

150
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,550
as they clearly dominate in the
traditional entertainment lane.

151
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,570
I've got we got to jump in on that.
That gaming side of the equation and the

152
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,630
lackluster, I mean, are they going to
continue down the gaming path?

153
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,710
Ed wants to know.
The reports are that they are developing

154
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,250
a triple-A game, which is what I think
gamers most associate with those big

155
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,240
classic console games.
Now, the success or failure of that will

156
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,130
certainly say a lot about the health and
longevity of their video game efforts.

157
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,970
Now, do they need it to succeed?
Not in the interim, but moving forward?

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,240
Long term, yes, I think they need to
branch out beyond just film and

159
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,500
television to create a stickier bundle
that solves for multiple consumer pain

160
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,740
points.
Brendon Katz, senior entertainment

161
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,710
industry strategist at Paradigm.
It's great to have you back here on

162
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,720
Bloomberg Technology.
Thank you so much.

163
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,040
Coming up, Apple sees unexpected demand
in China.

164
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,780
We speak about that and the broader tech
market with Angelo Cook-Off of Edward

165
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,640
Jones.
That conversation is coming up.

166
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,200
This is Bloomberg Technology.

167
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,690
The renaissance of growth has begun for
Apple with iPhone 16.

168
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,970
I think China, look, that was the
biggest issue.

169
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,220
That was a headwind.
Now it's a tailwind.

170
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,940
They have mojo going into the next, I
think, 6 to 9 months.

171
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,170
And that's why I look why the bears, if
you fire in a crowded theater for the

172
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,310
last month, but I think they go back
into hibernation mode in our opinion.

173
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,710
I was a very colorful Dan Ives of
Wedbush Securities.

174
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,610
On Apple's China turnaround.
Does the data provide a counterpoint?

175
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:45,450
Research says iPhone 16 sales so 20% in
the country in its first three weeks.

176
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,210
For more, let's bring in Bloomberg's
Mark Gurman.

177
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:53,880
Now, when we've discussed some third
party data, it's usually been negative.

178
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,200
And then Apple with actual data in the
earnings context has proven it wrong.

179
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:03,180
This is counterpoint research data.
That is a surprise and it's a positive

180
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,780
surprise.
What does it tell us about iPhone six in

181
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:12,340
that market?
Barely think it tells us anything new.

182
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,900
I think it tells us that the first three
weeks of iPhone sales, as they usually

183
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,850
are, were pretty hot.
Right.

184
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,640
The issue was never the opening month of
the device.

185
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,410
The issue was over the long term.
Right.

186
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,840
Three, six, nine months to 12 months for
the full cycle of that device.

187
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,430
I think some analysts have been a little
irrational or irresponsible in their

188
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,910
commentary on the iPhone 16 over the
last several months.

189
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,580
Some analysts have gone as far as
claiming that this is going to create a

190
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,810
supercycle, something we haven't seen
since the iPhone first launched on China

191
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,810
mobile with bigger screens a decade ago.
Right.

192
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,920
They've been saying that Apple
intelligence is something that is going

193
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,210
to drive a supercycle, despite the fact
that Apple intelligence is not available

194
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,650
in China.
Right.

195
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,830
So you can't necessarily have it both
ways.

196
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,810
You can't say that it's going to create
a supercycle in China.

197
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,390
Well, A.I.
is not available in China, right?

198
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,810
I'm not entirely surprised.
The iPhone 16 is doing well in the

199
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,400
region.
There's a lot of pent up demand.

200
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,760
There's a lot of people in China who
didn't upgrade the prior two years, the

201
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,810
iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 15 pro.
The iPhone six has some nice

202
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,780
improvements.
Right.

203
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,110
I think the camera control interface is
excellent.

204
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,270
Right.
I think the speed improvements in the

205
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,700
battery life improvements are really
nice touches.

206
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,700
I've enjoyed those personally.
So I think it's a good upgrade for

207
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,700
people who haven't bought a new iPhone
in the past few years, so I'm not

208
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,790
entirely surprised.
And typically, even when the data is

209
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,000
negative, right, I typically come on
here and say is we're not going to know

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,740
the truth until Apple earnings.
Right.

211
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,430
That's the case even when it's positive.
And so at the end of this month, we'll

212
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,770
get a better idea of how accurate this
information is.

213
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:51,070
Mark, next time we are bringing you and
Dan, I've supercycle man on together for

214
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,490
some fighting talk.
We love it today but more broadly, what

215
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,420
do you think that there is not bits to
love with an iPhone six.

216
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,300
The bit that I'm just so questioning is
the key element.

217
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,520
You've told this story again and again
on your own X platform in particular.

218
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,800
Why?
Who are they going to partner with in

219
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,840
China?
How are they going to really reap the

220
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,250
benefits of the artificial intelligence?
Yeah.

221
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,380
So there's two components really to the
API push in the iPhone, right?

222
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,830
There's the in-house large language
models and generative A.I.

223
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,960
features.
Those are using an Apple model.

224
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,010
Those are running on Apple servers.
And then there is the third party

225
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,430
component that's integrated into Siri
and other parts of the operating system

226
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,120
in the U.S.
They're using so far starting in

227
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,310
December.
And they're also planning to integrate

228
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,210
Google Gemini and to open it up to other
LMS in the future.

229
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,940
So you have an array of choices in
China.

230
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Most of those providers in the U.S.
are not available, so they're going to

231
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,640
have to partner with local entities.
Baidu being one option.

232
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,220
Obviously, you have Tencent, obviously
you have different bespoke labs in the

233
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,920
region.
But the other component is how is Apple

234
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,460
going to get approval from the Chinese
government to use their server

235
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,340
infrastructure to power their in-house
generative A.I.

236
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,180
models, which are in fact the bigger
deal, right, for Apple intelligence

237
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,400
notification summaries, writing tools,
image Generation Z emojis to create your

238
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,330
own emojis, right?
At least for iCloud, they have to use a

239
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,150
partner right in China with government
affiliation.

240
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,810
And so they may end up having to do
something similar if they want to get

241
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,260
Apple intelligence working in China.
Right.

242
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,300
And China is one of two major markets,
the other being the European Union,

243
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,730
where the A.I.
features are not available on the

244
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,800
iPhone.
And there's no clear release date for

245
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,230
when that will happen.
And I don't anticipate that happening

246
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,330
for at least a year.
Nice.

247
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,940
Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.
Keep your eyes peeled for his power on

248
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,590
news that this weekend in Korea as we're
showing, clearly Apple and its gains are

249
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,320
a factor in the market this Friday.
They are.

250
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,880
Let's talk about that, about the broader
market with Angelo Cephas, his senior

251
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,950
investment strategist over at Edward
Jones.

252
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,180
And just let's dwell on Apple for a
moment and what it signals that we got

253
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,630
UK retail data out today that said it
was buoyed by things like the Apple

254
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:10,070
iPhone but also Google's pixel as well.
How important is consumer to Apple right

255
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,540
now and how resilient is it?
Yeah, I think today's strength in

256
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,910
Mega-cap tech, including Apple, is
really a reminder not to dismiss

257
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,820
technology.
Technology actually remains a bright

258
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,430
spot.
The consumer clearly has been the main

259
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,390
driver for not only some of these
technology names, but for really the

260
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,700
broader economy and the bull markets
thesis.

261
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,490
And we keep getting good news on that
front.

262
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:40,220
Economic surprises are turning positive.
Just retail sales this week expressed

263
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,910
some strength and resilience.
So the economy is nowhere near

264
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,540
recession, especially in the U.S.
The same applies to abroad.

265
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,780
Now, China is a complicated story, to
say the least.

266
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,220
But at the same time, there's some signs
of bottom in that also feeds into the

267
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,610
Apple story.
We've had pledges from policymakers to

268
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,140
support growth.
Many questions remain.

269
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,180
What's going to actually be the lever?
But at least from a sentiment investor

270
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,480
sentiment perspective seems like the
worst is behind us.

271
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,220
Angelo, when you talk about profitable
tack, historically, it's like in the

272
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,630
context of having amazing balance sheet
entrenched market position.

273
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,750
But here on Bloomberg Technology, we
talk about innovation.

274
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,890
That's what Mark was reporting on, which
is the more important factor to the

275
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,640
investor.
I think it's both.

276
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,690
But you have that long, long term
secular thesis.

277
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,560
There's a long runway for growth,
especially on artificial intelligence.

278
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,450
But also you have the reality of market
swings and rotations have happened

279
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,920
because of the industry backdrop in the
more near-term and both moderate based

280
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,190
on your time horizon.
Think about the current backdrop.

281
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,910
We have an economy that is still growing
at a very solid pace.

282
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,560
Corporate profits are on the rise and at
the same time, interest rates are moving

283
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,010
lower.
And that backdrop provides a little more

284
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,480
tailwinds for areas of the market that
have been really left behind over the

285
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,750
past 18 months.
The big cap technology companies,

286
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,570
they're in a net cash position.
They have more cash than debt.

287
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,550
So they've been benefiting from the rise
in interest rates.

288
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,150
Right.
And other areas have been hit.

289
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,620
On the flip side, as interest rates move
lower.

290
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,500
You are seeing really that broadening
start to play out.

291
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,120
Angela, it's been great having some time
with you.

292
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,720
Thank you very much indeed.
Talking all through the valuation story,

293
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,410
Angelo Krakoff is senior investment
strategist at Edward Jones.

294
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,560
Now we just want to keep a close eye on
some other stocks that are on the move

295
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,720
at the moment.
And we're looking at American Express

296
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,300
coming up by 3.8% have been off by more
than 5%.

297
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:43,460
We are getting a refocusing in terms of
its revenue forecast, maybe its 9%

298
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,250
growth for the year rather than up to 9
to 11%.

299
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,330
But we did speak to the CEO, Stephen
Squeri, and he's been telling us

300
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,240
something by television that we've had
ten consecutive quarters of record

301
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,010
revenue.
And really good quarter.

302
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,680
We beat our own expectations.
The Street to we're raising guidance

303
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,400
when it comes to earnings per share.
We'll see how the stock continues

304
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,900
perform.
Remember, it has been Nair's records as

305
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,570
well.
Coming up, why some strategists are

306
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,350
urging caution for those investing
billions into volatile Chinese stock

307
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,450
ETFs.
This is Bloomberg Technology.

308
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,310
Let's turn to China now.
Investors are learning that Chinese

309
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:32,810
stock ETFs and now among the most risky,
the performance over the long haul has

310
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,740
made some of the biggest wealth
destroyers among US ETFs.

311
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,950
It's about to be reported on this.
And time and time again, you've come on

312
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,530
to tell us about how China is faring in
the macro context.

313
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,140
And we're looking at K Webb in
particular.

314
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,350
It's got all of our Chinese tech names
that are listed here.

315
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,980
It's been painful, very painful.
So this is a story about how market

316
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,210
timing is tough, but especially tougher
for other sectors, especially China.

317
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,010
So we looked at all ETF set an aim of
above 1 billion and we basically

318
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,670
subtracted assets and net inflows
because net inflows is less than the

319
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,980
assets.
It means investors lost money over their

320
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,620
lifetime.
And among that list, Chinese ETFs were

321
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,800
at the top, and Cathie Wood's ARK funds
a couple of them.

322
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,360
So back to Chinese ETF, you mentioned
Quip over its inception since 2013,

323
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,770
investors ploughed in 12 billion, but
its assets right now is just 6.9

324
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,560
billion.
So that's a valuation gap of 5 billion.

325
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,850
And after K12, it is Cathie Wood's
flagship ARK fund that also lost

326
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,670
investors money.
For context, you look at SPI, which is

327
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,450
the biggest and most liquid ETF
investors pulled in 160 billion.

328
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,800
Right now it's around 700 billion.
So you see that investors were rewarded

329
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,870
there.
So it's really hard for the Chinese

330
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,930
ETFs.
Is about.

331
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:48,820
You said timing The market is hard.
But more recently, China stimulus.

332
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,470
And then on the regulatory side, take
video games, for example, signals that

333
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,020
policy might support some of those
names.

334
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,770
So now you're asking, okay, well, what's
the trajectory from here?

335
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,760
Exactly.
So I want to bring it back to 2021.

336
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,600
So Caleb saw fantastic inflows, then 7.4
billion.

337
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,390
That's when investors were kind of
optimistic that China will see a rebound

338
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,110
from the doldrums of the pandemic.
But also that year to year point, we saw

339
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,740
a deepening housing crisis.
We saw some industries being really

340
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,460
cracked down on and we saw that ETF
tumble 52%.

341
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,900
Fast forward to today.
We saw a massive stimulus blitz in three

342
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,030
weeks.
We saw a lot of indexes tracking Chinese

343
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,600
stocks rise 40%.
And we saw investors also plowing

344
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,150
billions into the Chinese ETFs,
including Kay Webb.

345
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,450
But they're now taking a step back.
Chinese shares are kind of faltering.

346
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,620
We're seeing that rally kind of fizzle.
So it raises the question, will we see

347
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:46,060
something like that again?
And China is really just it's a very

348
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,180
vulnerable vehicle.
It's very volatile.

349
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,780
So it's really one thing that investors
should think about when they invest in

350
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,410
those kind of ETFs.
Bloomberg's Isabel is one of the best

351
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,470
read stories today on the Bloomberg
terminal and dot com and that's why we

352
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,840
wanted you on the program.
Thank you very much indeed.

353
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,010
Now coming up here on Bloomberg
Technology, the future of American made

354
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,970
semiconductor chips.
Michelle Guida from the Crack Institute

355
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,570
of Tech Diplomacy at Purdue University
is here.

356
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,140
We also have Bloomberg's best and
brightest on the week that was in semis.

357
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,030
This is Bloomberg Technology.

358
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,670
Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology.
I'm Caroline Hyde in New York and I met

359
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,890
Ivo in San Francisco to check on these
markets because we had a volatile one.

360
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,040
Let's put it because the Nasdaq has been
pushed around by those chip names that

361
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,650
we're going to dig into in a moment.
We're currently still holding on ground

362
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,340
for 10% for the last five trading days,
telling us had a nice little five day

363
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,690
performance.
Crypto.

364
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,270
Move it on and have a look at what's
happened with MicroStrategy Benchmark.

365
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,810
Also the analyst they're raising the
price target but MicroStrategy, one of

366
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,660
the biggest points contributors to the
Nasdaq 100 today.

367
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,660
Netflix I mean the standout of the day
up 10%.

368
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,200
Record high, 5 million subscribers being
added in the previous quarter, and

369
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,500
they're going to eclipse that in the
fiscal fourth quarter and last year.

370
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,560
Look at ASML.
This is a recovery, maybe a buy the dip

371
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,890
story on this particular day.
We're up just 3% on the US listed and

372
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,340
and European listed.
I'm currently looking at the dnb one's

373
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,360
up some 3%.
It has been sold off 14% over the course

374
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,670
of the week.
We know why the war is on orders.

375
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,330
The war is on everything else.
Bar, A.I.

376
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,280
chip equipment.
Basically what we got in the chip

377
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,110
sector.
Let me take you on a journey over just

378
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,570
five days.
There's been seismic shifts in

379
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,650
semiconductor sentiment.
It all started with chip equipment maker

380
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,970
ASML, surprising with early release of
results, cutting its outlook and

381
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,020
injecting growth concerns.
But by week's end, TSMC CHIP contract

382
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,310
manufacturers the world settled nerves,
boosting sales growth predictions and

383
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,690
spending plans, signaling the air
investment cycle might be okay.

384
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,290
And Vedere is flirting with some new
record highs.

385
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,940
Bloomberg's Ian King, who leads
semiconductor coverage, is here with us.

386
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,720
And that's the point.
The eye of the semiconductor industry is

387
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,300
okay.
Everything else, I think we're still a

388
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,650
little bit worried about.
Yeah, no, that's absolutely right.

389
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,430
The biggest concern, because that's
where all the money has been poured into

390
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,790
is is this high demand that we've seen
all these huge orders for Nvidia

391
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,850
supported.
Is this something that can continue?

392
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,320
And we got evidence that yes, that's the
case, at least for now.

393
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:39,930
What investors turn their attention to
is that other areas, automotive,

394
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:44,700
industrial PC, maybe not so good.
Let's dwell on the automotive part

395
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,210
though, in because you had a great story
with Mackenzie Hawkins talking about how

396
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,150
wall speed is going to be getting money
from the likes of Apollo, going to be

397
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,380
expanding its manufacturing for EV
chips.

398
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,900
So why that?
Yeah, I mean, this this is the little

399
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,580
tech company that apparently now can.
And there were existential concerns

400
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,880
about this company.
Literally, it was running out of money.

401
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,960
It's had a lot of problems bringing
online some new manufacturing.

402
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,620
And, you know, there were a lot of notes
out there, a lot of analysts saying

403
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,220
maybe this company needs to be bought,
it needs to go away, needs something.

404
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,220
Now, it got this, you know, massive
injection into its balance sheet, which

405
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,660
should allow it to emerge from this dark
place that it's been in.

406
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,650
Huge share reaction to that that that
we've obviously seen this week.

407
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,590
But still, the stock market does not
love this company.

408
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,850
The funny thing is, is the earnings
season is kind of back again.

409
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,890
And to go to your first point on the
everything else part, Texas Instruments

410
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,520
is kind of up first.
It's the everything Chip's name.

411
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,160
Just to explain that and why you'll be
paying close attention.

412
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,440
Yeah, we're going to have them reporting
on Tuesday.

413
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,190
And like you said, they are everything
else, automotive, industrial, of their

414
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,920
two biggest markets.
They make analog and embedded

415
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,800
processors.
These markets haven't been great.

416
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,840
You know, a lot of the typical sort of
everybody in everybody out cycle of PC

417
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,690
and smartphone, that kind of trend has
kind of gone away.

418
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,900
And we've seen all of these individual
markets moving in different ways.

419
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,510
Texas Instruments has been really
struggling.

420
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,140
And how they might change the narrative
is is if they give us any

421
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,440
hope.
I'm kind of comments about what's coming

422
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,570
in the future that says maybe we're
through the worst.

423
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,390
That could be a positive.
But if you actually look at the numbers,

424
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,630
we're still struggling.
The index in King Reste, up we go again

425
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,400
next week.
Thank you very much, Kara.

426
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,140
Look, we've got to talk now about how
politics plays its role as well, the

427
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,300
intersection of technology and politics,
a major decision facing whoever, of

428
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:45,210
course, wins the White House next month,
how to regulate US chip industry in

429
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,640
particular, to stay ahead of global
competition.

430
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,430
Let's dig into that.
Michelle Greta, she's the CEO of Hatch

431
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,570
Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue
University.

432
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:59,520
Michel, the context with which we talk
about Invidious and some of the other

433
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,310
key players is the limitations of
selling into China.

434
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:05,410
That was a key story for small, for
example, going forward.

435
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,780
Is that going to perpetuate itself?
Caroline, You're right.

436
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,710
Context is really important here.
And when you think about it, it's just

437
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,670
reflective of the new paradigm that
we're in, in which tech has to do very

438
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,000
much with the future of American
prosperity and American national

439
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,120
security.
So just as we have to scrutinize which

440
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,320
countries we're sending F-35s to.
We also have to scrutinize where we're

441
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,250
sending our most advanced chips to which
also power our F-35s.

442
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,800
And these aren't hairdryers that we're
talking about.

443
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,920
And why we have to look at this is
ultimately it comes down to trust.

444
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,620
Do we trust the companies?
Do we trust the countries that we're

445
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,980
going to be sending our in video chips
and our most advanced critical

446
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,120
technology to with the understanding
that it's not going to end up in the

447
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,290
hands of some of our adversaries, like
Russia, like China and the People's

448
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:58,770
Liberation Army.
Do you have a clear sense of any benefit

449
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:04,800
being derived from current and existing
policy on semiconductors for the United

450
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,420
States?
Look, we've taken measures over the

451
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,050
course of a couple of administrations
now to make sure that we're preventing

452
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,080
our most critical technology from going
to our adversaries and specifically

453
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,960
China.
But this is why tech diplomacy is also

454
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,540
really important.
When I was assistant secretary of state,

455
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,660
I was traveling all across the world.
And the number one thing that you hear

456
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,600
from our allies and partners is that
they want U.S.

457
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,380
private sector investment.
Well, it's really hard to do that when

458
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:36,170
you have Chinese technology, untrusted
technology embedded into your government

459
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:40,880
infrastructure and across your country.
And so you want to make sure that you're

460
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,090
using trusted technology.
If you look at the U.S.

461
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,810
and 12 of our closest Democratic
partners, we make up 12 at almost two

462
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,080
thirds of global GDP.
China, Russia, Iran.

463
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,650
Venezuela is less than 20% of GDP.
So you want to be a part of the big

464
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,920
network.
There's a lot of financial opportunity,

465
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,670
diplomatic opportunity in that.
And so we've started to, through

466
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:06,020
American policy, implement the right
policies around semiconductors to make

467
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,940
sure that we are helping the partners in
that trusted network and not in the

468
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,210
untrusted network.
Michel.

469
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,990
Earlier this week, Bloomberg's editor in
chief, John Micklethwait, spoke to

470
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:21,880
former President Trump and very directly
tried to get a sense of what his policy

471
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,180
will be with regards to China.
Let's listen to his comments.

472
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,360
But the reason they're doing it now is
they're not going to do it afterwards.

473
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,260
Okay.
Since, you know, so they're doing it

474
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,700
now.
They want to do it.

475
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,220
And I look at it now.
I had a very

476
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,010
good relationship with president.
She had a very good relationship with

477
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,910
Putin and a very good relationship with
Kim Jong un, who is a nuclear force that

478
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:51,210
you won't even believe.
President Trump discussed his good

479
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,200
relationship with Xi, but I think many
agree that we didn't get an

480
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,700
understanding of whether he would
continue with the existing stance of

481
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,670
sort of export control on leading edge
Chip.

482
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,190
What is your expectation if President
Trump were to take office in November or

483
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,020
in January of next year?
But remember, export controls on

484
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,130
critical technology from China began
under President Trump and specifically

485
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,230
with Huawei.
This is with regards to 5G.

486
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:22,970
While we ultimately lost $30 billion in
annual revenue because the United States

487
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,930
under President Trump worked with 60
countries and 200 telecommunications

488
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:31,160
companies to only use trusted vendors in
5G, and that did not include Huawei.

489
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,090
We've seen those export controls
continue now under the Biden

490
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,270
administration.
It's been on chips lately, but I think

491
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,570
you can start to see this is American
foreign policy.

492
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,370
Now, not only that, the Congress is very
bipartisan.

493
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,250
Just a couple of days ago, the China
Select Committee called for putting more

494
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,820
Chinese companies on the entity list.
This is Huawei's network of clandestine

495
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,020
companies, which American companies are
sending semiconductor manufacturing

496
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,450
equipment.
So this is a very bipartisan thing, and

497
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:04,370
we should expect it to continue.
And yet, Michel, companies still want to

498
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,700
access the Chinese consumer.
Apple still wants to build its phones

499
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,510
there, still wants to access the
consumer that NVIDIA still wants to sell

500
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,330
its less sophisticated chips over to
China, too.

501
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,290
What is a CEO to do?
What does Jensen Huang or Tim Cook to do

502
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,420
in that situation?
Well, it's really interesting, actually.

503
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,570
It was a Bloomberg reporter just a
couple of weeks ago, had asked Jensen

504
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:28,350
Huang his take on the China export
controls, and he said he had to defer

505
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,980
policymaking to the United States.
Unfortunately, in the world that we live

506
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,310
in when it comes to American national
security, that's not anything that any

507
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,920
CEO of a critical tech company can
defer.

508
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:42,030
We all have to be in this together and
in what's ultimately a technology race.

509
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,830
American CEOs and tech CEOs in
particular need to make sure that we are

510
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,490
advancing our tech competitiveness.
At the same time, we're not giving that

511
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,850
technology to our adversaries who are
dedicated to our demise.

512
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,730
So there's a very big leadership role
for CEOs.

513
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,910
Michelle Wieder, fantastic to have some
time with you.

514
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,300
Thank you.
CEO of the Institute for Tech Diplomacy

515
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,830
at Purdue University.
Coming up, why Tesla driverless car

516
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,830
program is the target for federal
investigators.

517
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,860
This is Bloomberg Technology.
That's optimistic goals.

518
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,290
Okay.
Last week's Tesla Robotaxi event was so

519
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,620
underwhelming that Wall Street is
questioning the stock's premium

520
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,530
valuation.
The so-called ROBOTAXI has been crucial

521
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,810
to keeping Tesla's stock at Lofty
Heights.

522
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,610
It's trading at around 75 times forward
earnings on hopes that A.I.

523
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,120
will recreate the auto industry through
Musk's vision.

524
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,400
Here's a look at the stock since the
event.

525
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:57,050
The next catalyst to watch is, of
course, third quarter results, for which

526
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:00,560
I will be glued to my desk along with
everyone else around the world.

527
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,190
Karoline, will you be?
Of course.

528
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,840
What brutal chore.
Meanwhile, we've got to be glued to

529
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,990
something else, said the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

530
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,230
It's investigating Tesla's powerful
automation system.

531
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,150
They market it as full self-driving and
it's following concerns it is defective.

532
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,660
After a series of crashes, one which
resulted in a fatality.

533
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,910
Bloomberg's Craig Trudel relentless on
this.

534
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,550
Craig This is to do with the weather,
right?

535
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:32,550
Yeah, this is at least sort of the
grounds for the investigation that is

536
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,720
sort of narrowly looking at the issue of
of, you know, when Teslas are being

537
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:44,470
operated on FSD and in in an environment
where visibility isn't great.

538
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,400
So think of like foggy conditions.
But I would point out that it's not

539
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,600
necessarily the case that these
investigations would sort of stay in

540
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,070
that narrow scope where we've seen a
precedent just with autopilot, this sort

541
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:01,900
of standard driver assistance system
that you get when you buy a Tesla that

542
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:08,050
we saw in its open in an investigation
after multiple crashes involving police

543
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:12,940
cars or fire trucks.
And that investigation led to a much

544
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,429
broader recall where Tesla sort of, you
know, came around to this idea that, you

545
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,110
know, what next.
You're right.

546
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,909
We will sort of, you know, find that
there's a defect with our system, that

547
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:27,190
people aren't paying enough attention
while they use it.

548
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,520
And we'll we'll do a remedy to try and
address that.

549
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,500
Craig, as you note, because you're one
of the editors of my reporting about

550
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,540
Tesla, I'm an FSD user, and actually
I've posted on quite a lot about using

551
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:46,090
it in foggy conditions and some of the
bizarre happenings when using the

552
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,300
technology.
One question that I have and many have

553
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,469
is about this probe and how it's
different from prior probes and why

554
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:57,610
actually this time around it may have
teeth, so to speak.

555
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,600
Whereas, you know, in the past we
haven't seen much happen after the

556
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,210
probe.
Yeah, I think it's interesting.

557
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:09,410
These these defect investigations tend
to take quite a bit of time.

558
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,280
I mentioned the autopilot one.
It took, you know, I think several years

559
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,460
really for for anything to really come
of that.

560
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:21,680
And, you know, so so that is one thing
to note, that it's a tends to move at a

561
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,050
speed that is not sort of befitting of
our, you know, modern sort of daily

562
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:29,030
drumbeat of headlines.
Age.

563
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,560
I do think that what's interesting here
is that, you know, just with that that

564
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,750
autopilot investigation that
precipitated a recall, Tesla was able to

565
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,710
address that with an over-the-air
software update, or at least they tried

566
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,110
to do so.
And it's has gone back and said, you

567
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,150
know what, We're not sure that that went
far enough.

568
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,140
So I think when you ask about, you know,
whether or not this could have teeth, I

569
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,070
think the real question here, if you're
a Tesla investor, is, you know, will

570
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,670
Nitze get to the point where they say,
you know what, Tesla, we think that you

571
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:03,950
don't have sufficient hardware to for
people to be able to use these systems

572
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,430
safely.
And do you need to do more for, you

573
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:11,120
know, monitoring drivers better and
install equipment to do that?

574
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:15,560
Do you need to put in sensors to handle
these these poor visibility conditions

575
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,450
that would cost Tesla some real money?
And does that question the pace, which

576
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:26,270
is slower than rivals of a cyber cab or
a fully independently driving car that

577
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:32,090
we already see on the streets of Waymo?
Yeah, I think it's key here that, you

578
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:38,000
know, it's a I think this is going to
have to, you know, have some say in

579
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,340
Tesla following through on what Musk
said last week about being able to offer

580
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:48,650
a version of FSD that doesn't have to be
supervised, at least in certain states.

581
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:52,430
You know, Musk mentioned that in Texas
and California.

582
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:58,010
You know, it's it just strikes me as
hard to sort of take him at his word

583
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:02,990
that that timeline can possibly be
achieved when we're seeing evidence, you

584
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:08,000
know, year after year of of crashes
involving people using these systems

585
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:14,030
and, you know, them not necessarily, you
know, being safe enough to to

586
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,530
regulator's liking.
MUSK Ambitious timelines.

587
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:23,690
Right now we thank you and.
Yeah, plenty more news in today's

588
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,250
talking tech.
And first stop.

589
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,370
What's the story?
Japanese software developer Fuji Soft is

590
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:33,770
sticking with taken off for its shares
despite receiving a higher bid from Bain

591
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,240
Capital.
This is Fuji.

592
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,520
Soft Executives has shown doubt about
the feasibility of Bain's goal of taking

593
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,230
the company private.
We'll track that one.

594
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:47,090
Plus, Google's moving the team behind
its Gemini AI assistant app to its

595
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,840
DeepMind research lab.
It's part of a plan to consolidate the

596
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,570
company's sprawling AI structure.
And Verizon will buy $1 billion worth of

597
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,720
US cellular spectrum licenses for its
core business.

598
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,760
US cellular controls, one of the largest
tower businesses in the United States.

599
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,920
All right.
Coming up on the program, we've got a

600
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,900
deeper look at what's next for Netflix.
Plenty more to discuss after earnings.

601
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,730
This is Bloomberg Technology.

602
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,080
Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology.
Let's take a look at where Netflix is at

603
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,600
right now.
Earnings just beating investor

604
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,910
expectations.
The stock is up ten and a half percent.

605
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,990
Biggest jump since January of this year
and the stock is trading at all time

606
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,700
highs.
Let's go in-house.

607
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,990
Let's bring in geeta ranganathan,
bloomberg intelligence and Geeta, your

608
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,780
research you published this morning.
We'll get right to it.

609
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,930
You look at the subscriber gains, that
was a surprise.

610
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,320
But you also judging Netflix on its
margins.

611
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,790
And it's really interesting to me
because Netflix for ages was like stop

612
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,150
obsessing over subscribers.
Judge us on our financial metrics.

613
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,130
Well, you are.
Y

614
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,930
yeah, absolutely.
And so, you know, it was really a broad

615
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,810
based very, very good report, as you
just pointed out.

616
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,580
And yes, this has shifted now from being
just principally a subscriber story to

617
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,450
now more of an all rounded kind of
financial story as well.

618
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:28,040
So good topline revenue growth, but more
importantly, that topline revenue growth

619
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,050
kind of translating into very, very
solid bottom line growth, very solid

620
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,080
profitability.
And we saw that yesterday in Netflix,

621
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,610
almost flirting with 30% operating
margin in the third quarter.

622
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:44,810
And then look at their guidance.
When we came into 2024, they were

623
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:48,530
expecting or they were guiding margins
at about 22%.

624
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,400
Yesterday, they lifted it again from 24,
25, 26 and now 27% operating margins.

625
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:59,420
And again, the target that they set for
2025 looks really, really conservative

626
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,640
to us.
But this is basically this goes back to

627
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,330
the age old question of us always
asking, you know, does streaming

628
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:09,860
economics really do they make sense?
Can this model be as good as the

629
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,790
original traditional TV model?
And Netflix has proven to us that it can

630
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,800
be done.
What's interesting, though, is the

631
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:21,860
previous chart we just showed is strong
subscribers, but still a slowing growth

632
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,560
trajectory.
And I'm interested by perhaps Latin

633
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,580
America seeing no growth in subscribers.
Why is that happening?

634
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,980
Where is it happening?
Yes.

635
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,230
So, you know, it is a little bit of up
and down.

636
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:37,010
So they did talk about Latin America
being a little bit of a timing issue.

637
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,990
They're actually now continuing to see
good growth starting in the in the

638
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:46,070
calendar fourth quarter.
But, you know, there are mature markets

639
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,520
and there are markets where there is
going to be a lot of growth.

640
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:53,450
So if you kind of just look at it as us
versus rest of the world, 80% of

641
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,430
subscriber growth comes from the rest of
the world.

642
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:59,510
So the US obviously is the most mature
market, but there still are pockets

643
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,370
across the world.
Karoline, whether you're looking at Asia

644
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:05,300
Pacific or India.
India, for instance, last quarter for

645
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,290
them was one of their most, you know,
highest growing markets in terms of

646
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,870
number of new subscribers as well as in
terms of revenue growth.

647
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,200
So they do have pockets all across the
world, whether it's in Eastern Europe,

648
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,250
whether it's in Asia-Pacific, where they
are going to try and reinvigorate

649
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,230
subscriber growth.
And those are going to be their biggest

650
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:27,120
areas of opportunity going forward.
Geyser Bloomberg Intelligence House Call

651
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,610
Is Netflix still the number one streamer
and will it always be the number one

652
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,060
streamer?
I think so, Ed.

653
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,600
I mean, they definitely have one.
The streaming wars right now as we as we

654
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,290
kind of look at it way ahead of
everybody else, way ahead of the

655
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,500
competition, not just in terms of
subscriber numbers, even if you look at

656
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,910
them in terms of engagement.
Remember, they are just a smidge behind

657
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,090
YouTube.
And YouTube has over 2 billion viewers

658
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,310
across the world.
It's a free service, right?

659
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,700
And you're looking at Netflix where, you
know, it's a paying subscription

660
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,600
service, a little bit of a different
model, but they still have almost close

661
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:08,780
to 10% of viewing time in the US, which
is just a smidge, again, behind behind

662
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,700
YouTube.
So I think, you know, definitely the

663
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,230
number one service globally and they
will consolidate that lead over all of

664
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,800
their rivals.
